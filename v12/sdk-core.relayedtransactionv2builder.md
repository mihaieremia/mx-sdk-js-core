## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [build()](./sdk-core.relayedtransactionv2builder.build.md) |  | Tries to build the relayed v2 transaction based on the previously set fields. It returns a transaction that isn't signed |
|  [setInnerTransaction(transaction)](./sdk-core.relayedtransactionv2builder.setinnertransaction.md) |  | Sets the inner transaction to be used. It has to be already signed and with gasLimit set to 0. These checks are performed on the build() method |
|  [setInnerTransactionGasLimit(gasLimit)](./sdk-core.relayedtransactionv2builder.setinnertransactiongaslimit.md) |  | Sets the gas limit to be used for the SC Call inside the inner transaction |
|  [setNetworkConfig(netConfig)](./sdk-core.relayedtransactionv2builder.setnetworkconfig.md) |  | Sets the network config to be used for building the relayed v2 transaction |
|  [setRelayerAddress(relayerAddress)](./sdk-core.relayedtransactionv2builder.setrelayeraddress.md) |  | Sets the address of the relayer (the one that will actually pay the fee) |
|  [setRelayerNonce(relayerNonce)](./sdk-core.relayedtransactionv2builder.setrelayernonce.md) |  | (optional) Sets the nonce of the relayer |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [bech32()](./sdk-core.address.bech32.md) |  | Returns the bech32 representation of the address |
|  [empty()](./sdk-core.address.empty.md) | <code>static</code> | Creates an empty address object |
|  [equals(other)](./sdk-core.address.equals.md) |  | Compares the address to another address |
|  [fromAddress(address)](./sdk-core.address.fromaddress.md) | <code>static</code> | Creates an address object from another address object |
|  [fromBech32(value)](./sdk-core.address.frombech32.md) | <code>static</code> | Creates an address object from a bech32-encoded string |
|  [fromBuffer(buffer)](./sdk-core.address.frombuffer.md) | <code>static</code> | Creates an address object from a Buffer |
|  [fromHex(value)](./sdk-core.address.fromhex.md) | <code>static</code> | Creates an address object from a hex-encoded string |
|  [fromString(value)](./sdk-core.address.fromstring.md) | <code>static</code> | Creates an address object from a string (hex or bech32) |
|  [hex()](./sdk-core.address.hex.md) |  | Returns the hex representation of the address (pubkey) |
|  [isContractAddress()](./sdk-core.address.iscontractaddress.md) |  |  |
|  [isEmpty()](./sdk-core.address.isempty.md) |  | Returns whether the address is empty. |
|  [isValid(value)](./sdk-core.address.isvalid.md) | <code>static</code> | Performs address validation without throwing errors |
|  [pubkey()](./sdk-core.address.pubkey.md) |  | Returns the pubkey as raw bytes (buffer) |
|  [toJSON()](./sdk-core.address.tojson.md) |  | Converts the address to a pretty, plain JavaScript object. |
|  [toString()](./sdk-core.address.tostring.md) |  | Returns the bech32 representation of the address |
|  [Zero()](./sdk-core.address.zero.md) | <code>static</code> | Creates the Zero address (the one that should be used when deploying smart contracts) |

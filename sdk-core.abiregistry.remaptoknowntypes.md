## AbiRegistry.remapToKnownTypes() method

Right after loading ABI definitions into a registry, the endpoints and the custom types (structs, enums) use raw types for their I/O parameters (in the case of endpoints), or for their fields (in the case of structs).

A raw type is merely an instance of [Type](sdk-core.type.md)<!-- -->, with a given name and type parameters (if it's a generic type).

Though, for most (development) purposes, we'd like to operate using known, specific types (e.g. [List](sdk-core.list.md)<!-- -->, [U8Type](sdk-core.u8type.md) etc.). This function increases the specificity of the types used by parameter / field definitions within a registry (on best-efforts basis). The result is an equivalent, more explicit ABI registry.

**Signature:**

```typescript
remapToKnownTypes(): AbiRegistry;
```
**Returns:**

[AbiRegistry](sdk-core.abiregistry.md)
